Natural Log
-----------

Natural Log (`ln` for short) is a time series database with a REST API.  The
database records time-varying scalars, arrays, and generic binary data at
irregularly-spaced intervals, and supports time-oriented queries on that data.
It is primarily intended for logging numeric data, rather than string messages
like syslog.

**WARNING:** Natural Log is currently practicing "Documentation Driven
Development," so none of the code exists to do any of this yet.
